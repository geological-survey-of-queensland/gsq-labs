# Demo Resources for Graph Visualization Tool

## Overview

This folder contains a set of demo files that users can download and use to test the graph visualization tool. The resources are in various formats, such as `.json` for saved visualizations and `.ttl` (Turtle) files for conversion. Each demo file is a representation of graph data designed to showcase different features and capabilities of the visualization tool.

## Contents

Here is a list of the demo files available in this folder and a brief description of each:

- `ChronostratChart2023-09.ttl`: A point in time copy of the Chronostratigraphic Chart in ttl format.
- `ChronostratChart2023-09_filtered.json`: A visualisation of the above Chronostratigraphic with some nodes filtered out to improve readability.
- `mkd-minsys-combined.ttl`: A demo mockup of a mineral system and a geological setting (Mary Kathleen Domain) in the same graph.
- `mkd-minsys-combined.json`:  A visualisation of the above mockup of a mineral system and a geological setting (Mary Kathleen Domain) with some nodes filtered out.
- `mkd-minsys-obs-combined.ttl`: A demo mockup of a mineral system, a geological setting (Mary Kathleen Domain) and some lab results in the same graph.
- `mkd-minsys-obs-combined.json`: A visualisation of the above mockup of a mineral system, a geological setting (Mary Kathleen Domain) and some lab results with some nodes filtered out.
- `mkd-minsys-obs-filtered-for-iron-oxide_geoproperty.json`: A filtered visualisation of the above mockup of a mineral system, a geological setting (Mary Kathleen Domain) and some lab results showing a traversal pathway between a mineral system, geofeature and its respective results
- `ocr-text-search_prospective + mineralisation_graph_data.json`: A knowledge graph generated by automated analysis of OCR text and relevant metadata based on results from geospatially constrained search keywords. Results from [OCR Search Tool](https://geological-survey-of-queensland.github.io/gsq-labs/pages/ocr-search-tool/).
- `ocr-text-search_prospective + mineralisation_graph_data_filtered_view.json`: A filtered view of the above visualisation using the term 'copper mineralisation'


Additional note for loading ttl files :

### Optional TTL Load Setting
**Ignore nodes** by ID (using this exclusion string will ensure the demo ttls present in a cleaner view)

## Usage

To use these demo files with the graph visualization tool, follow these steps:

1. **Select a Demo File**: Browse the `/demo` folder and choose a demo file that matches the input format supported by the visualization tool.
2. **Download the File**: Click on the demo file to view it, then download it to your local system.
3. **Import the File**: Use the graph visualization tool's interface to load the downloaded file. This is typically done by clicking on the "Load Graph (JSON)" or "Load ttl" buttons and selecting the downloaded file from your file system.

## Additional Information

- The `.json` files should be provided in the format expected by the visualization tool, typically including `nodes` and `links` arrays.
- The `.ttl` files are in Turtle format, a popular RDF serialization that needs to be converted to a compatible JSON structure for visualization.
- The visualization tool might have specific features to handle the imported data, such as node grouping, color coding, or labeling, which can be observed and tested with these demo files.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while importing demo files:

- Ensure that the file format is correct and compatible with the tool.
- Check that the tool's converter is functioning properly if using Turtle files.
- Refer to the documentation of the visualization tool for detailed instructions on importing and visualizing data.
